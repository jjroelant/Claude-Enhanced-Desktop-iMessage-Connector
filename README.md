# Enhanced iMessage Connector for Claude Desktop

## 🚀 Why This Extension Exists

**Claude Desktop's built-in iMessage tools are broken.** They find 0 contacts when searching, fail with AppleScript errors, and can't handle multiple phone number formats for the same person.

**This enhanced connector actually works.** It finds thousands of contacts, reads real messages, and provides powerful analytics - all while being faster and more reliable than the built-in tools.

| Message Reading | ❌ Always fails | ✅ Thousands of messages | **Actually works** |
| Multi-handle Support | ❌ No | ✅ SMS + iMessage + RCS | **New capability** |
| Conversation Analytics | ❌ No | ✅ Daily breakdowns | **New capability** |
| Sentiment Analysis | ❌ No | ✅ 35+ hostile keywords | **New capability** |
| Dependencies | ❌ AppleScript (unreliable) | ✅ Direct SQLite (rock solid) | **Much more stable** |

## 🆚 Why Not Use Built-in Tools?

**Built-in iMessage tools consistently fail because:**
- ❌ **AppleScript Dependencies**: Breaks when Contacts app isn't running

- ❌ **Poor Contact Matching**: Misses variations in phone number formatting
- ❌ **No Error Recovery**: Fails silently with no useful feedback
- ❌ **Limited Functionality**: No analytics, sentiment analysis, or statistics

**This enhanced connector solves all these problems** with direct SQLite access and robust phone number matching.

- **No AppleScript**: Eliminates dependency failures
- **Multi-handle Resolution**: Finds all phone/email variations per contact
